## Detailed Findings

### Available Data Sources

#### Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram)
- **Status**: Fully Available
- **Tables**:
  - `b2s_meta_acquisition_demo_breakdown_by_date_report`
  - `b2s_meta_acquisition_demo_breakdown_by_date_report_staging`
  - `b2s_meta_acquisition_tech_breakdown_by_date_report`
  - `b2s_meta_acquisition_tech_breakdown_by_date_report_staging`
- **Schema**: Contains comprehensive Meta ads data including campaign, adset, and ad level metrics, demographic breakdowns, technical data (platform, device), and performance metrics (spend, impressions, clicks, conversions).
- **Notes**: The data appears complete and well-structured for Meta advertising platforms.

### Partially Available Data Sources

#### Google Ads
- **Status**: Partially Available
- **Tables**: Data appears to be included in several tables, including:
  - `client_offer_compare_table`
  - `media_buyers_table`
  - `v1_b2s_all_acquisition_production_report`
- **Confidence**: Medium - based on column evidence
- **Notes**: While Google Ads data appears to exist, it's not in dedicated tables like the Meta data. It may be consolidated with other sources in the main reporting tables. Additional investigation is needed to determine the completeness of Google Ads data.

### Missing Data Sources

The following data sources appear to be completely missing from current datasets:

1. **TikTok Ads**: No evidence of TikTok advertising data in any tables.
2. **Shopify**: No evidence of Shopify e-commerce data in any tables.
3. **Google Analytics**: No identifiable Google Analytics metrics or dimensions found.
4. **Triple Whale**: No Triple Whale attribution data found.
5. **Hyros**: No Hyros attribution data found.
6. **General Attribution Data**: No general attribution data structures identified.

## Integration Requirements

Based on the findings, the following data sources need to be integrated into the BigQuery environment:

1. **TikTok Ads**: Complete integration needed
2. **Shopify**: Complete integration needed
3. **Google Analytics**: Complete integration needed
4. **Triple Whale**: Complete integration needed
5. **Hyros**: Complete integration needed
6. **Google Ads**: May need dedicated tables or schema enhancements for more complete data

## Next Steps

1. **Google Ads Enhancement**: Investigate the current Google Ads data to determine if it's complete or requires a dedicated integration.
2. **TikTok Integration**: Set up a data pipeline to bring TikTok Ads data into BigQuery.
3. **Shopify Integration**: Connect Shopify data to BigQuery for e-commerce metrics.
4. **Analytics Integration**: Set up Google Analytics data pipeline to BigQuery.
5. **Attribution Data**: Implement Triple Whale and Hyros connections for attribution data.
6. **Schema Development**: Create appropriate schemas for new data sources that match existing patterns.
7. **Enhancement Implementation**: Implement the suggested enhancements to BigQuery for device and demographic segmentation and spend pacing.
