# Project Brief: AI-Powered Reporting & Creative Optimization for Built To Scale

**Client:** Built To Scale

**Primary Contact:** Jeremy Gillespie

**Project Leads:** Sean Akyildiz, Nate Sroor

**Communication:** Slack Channel

## **Project Overview**

Built To Scale is implementing AI-driven automation to optimize client reporting and creative strategy, eliminating manual workload for media buyers and account managers. The first phase focuses on automated performance reporting, followed by creative analysis and copy generation. The AI-powered system will generate weekly and on-demand reports, providing deeper insights and strategic recommendations.

## **Goals & Objectives**

	•	Automate Weekly Reporting to eliminate the 1+ hour per client per week spent on manual reports.

	•	Improve Reporting Quality with structured insights following a What, Where, Why, How framework.

	•	Enable On-Demand Reporting for urgent client performance requests.

	•	Leverage BigQuery for centralized data integration from all ad platforms and attribution sources (Triple Whale, Hyros).

	•	Introduce AI-Driven Creative Analysis & Copywriting for ad performance optimization.

	•	Separate Internal vs. Client-Facing Reports to streamline data presentation.

	•	Ensure Continuous Optimization & Scalability with AI-powered benchmarking and automated adjustments.

## **Project Scope**

**1\. AI-Powered Reporting System**

	•	**Fully automated weekly reports** sent every Monday.

	•	**On-demand reports** triggered manually for urgent client updates.

	•	**Standardized “What, Where, Why, How” structure** for insights.

	•	**Data segmentation by offer, campaign, and creative.**

	•	**Separation of internal (detailed) and client-facing (high-level) reports.**

	•	**Editable Google Docs & auto-generated PDFs** for easy delivery.

**2\. Data Sources & Integration**

	•	Primary Data Source: BigQuery

	•	Additional Data Sources:

	•	Meta Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads

	•	Shopify, Google Analytics

	•	Triple Whale, Hyros (attribution data)

	•	Enhancements to BigQuery:

	•	Add device and demographic segmentation for richer insights.

	•	Integrate spend pacing & performance benchmarks per offer.

**3\. Creative & Copy Optimization**

	•	AI-Generated Creative Insights to identify top-performing ads and scripts.

	•	Automated Copy Suggestions (hooks, headlines, CTAs, ad variations).

	•	Integration with Creative Teams for streamlined ad production.

	•	Future Expansion: AI-powered advertorials, PDP pages, upsell copywriting.

**4\. Performance Benchmarking & AI Fine-Tuning**

	•	Historical Performance Tracking to ensure AI insights align with past trends.

	•	Custom KPI Benchmarks per Offer to prevent misleading comparisons.

	•	Deviation-Based Alerts for performance anomalies (e.g., ROAS drop \>10%).

	•	Continuous Fine-Tuning based on platform changes and agency needs.

## **Implementation Plan (4-Week Timeline)**

**Week 1:**

	•	Access & Setup:

	•	Provide access to BigQuery, Looker Studio, and relevant platforms.

	•	Share sample reports for AI training.

	•	Finalize Miro board (high-level strategy overview).

**Week 2:**

	•	**AI Model Training & Data Structuring:**

	•	Define **reporting logic and automation triggers.**

	•	Set up **data pull configurations from BigQuery.**

	•	Establish **segmentation by offer, campaign, and creative.**

**Week 3:**

	•	**Testing & Refinements:**

	•	Run **internal report tests and validate AI outputs.**

	•	Ensure **client-facing reports are structured clearly.**

	•	Optimize **data integration accuracy (Triple Whale, Hyros, etc.).**

**Week 4:**

	•	**Finalization & Rollout:**

	•	Implement **auto-generation for weekly & on-demand reports.**

	•	Provide **team training & SOP documentation.**

	•	Conduct **final client review & approval.**
