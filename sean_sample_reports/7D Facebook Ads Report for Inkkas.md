# **Facebook Campaign Performance Overview: Inkkas (Last 3 Days)**

## **Campaign-Level Metrics Analysis**

**1\. \[Evestar\] Slip Ons / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR)** \* **Health Score: 8/10** \* **Reasoning:** This campaign exhibits excellent ROAS (2.21) and the lowest Cost Per Purchase ($50.47) among significant spenders, driving strong revenue ($6,246.52) and purchase volume (56). However, its Link CTR (0.90%) is the lowest across all campaigns, indicating a potential area for creative or targeting observation.  
**2\. \[Evestar\] Clearance / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR)** \* **Health Score: 7/10** \* **Reasoning:** Achieved a solid ROAS (2.04) slightly above the typical target, generating the highest revenue ($7,627.93) with good purchase volume (49). The Cost Per Purchase ($76.31) is relatively high, and Link CTR (1.44%) is average, suggesting room for efficiency improvements.  
**3\. \[Evestar\] Trekk Boots / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR)** \* **Health Score: 7/10** \* **Reasoning:** Performance is strong with a near-target ROAS (1.96), good purchase volume (39), and efficient Cost Per Purchase ($57.53). Concerns arise from a relatively high CPM ($20.21), although Link CTR (1.63%) is decent.  
**4\. \[Evestar\] Luminous Collection / USA / Advantage+ / Lowest Cost / 7-Day Click Campaign** \* **Health Score: 7/10** \* **Reasoning:** This campaign has the best Cost Per Purchase ($41.41) and an excellent Link CTR (2.67%), alongside good purchase volume (36) for its spend ($1,490.75). Performance is moderated by an okay ROAS (1.84) and a significantly high CPM ($26.57).  
**5\. \[Evestar\] Camping Boots / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR) Campaign** \* **Health Score: 6/10** \* **Reasoning:** Demonstrates strong purchase volume (53) and an efficient Cost Per Purchase ($56.39). However, the ROAS (1.78) is below target, and the Link CTR (1.05%) is quite low, indicating potential audience or creative friction.  
**6\. \[Evestar\] Sandals / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR)** \* **Health Score: 5/10** \* **Reasoning:** While achieving good purchase volume (51) with efficient CPP ($59.20) and the lowest CPM ($9.92), the campaign's ROAS (1.53) is considerably below target. The Link CTR (1.28%) is also low, impacting overall profitability.  
**7\. \[Evestar\] April 2025 UGC Testing / USA / ABO** \* **Health Score: 4/10** \* **Reasoning:** As a low-spend test ($194.87), this campaign shows poor ROAS (1.25) and very low purchase volume (3). Cost efficiency metrics (CPP $64.96, CPM $14.58, Link CTR 1.30%) are middling given the context of a test.  
**8\. \[Evestar\] Evergreen DPA / USA / Advantage+ / Lowest Cost / 7-Day Click** \* **Health Score: 3/10** \* **Reasoning:** This campaign is significantly underperforming with a poor ROAS (1.31) and a very high Cost Per Purchase ($101.48). The CPM ($22.73) is also elevated despite a reasonable Link CTR (1.69%).  
**9\. \[Evestar\] Joggers / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR)** \* **Health Score: 2/10** \* **Reasoning:** Performance is critical with no reported ROAS and only one purchase on minimal spend ($39.12). While CPP ($39.12) is low, the lack of volume and return makes it ineffective currently; CPM ($19.86) is high for a low-spend context.

## **Highest and Lowest Performing Campaigns**

* **Highest Performing:** \[Evestar\] Slip Ons / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR) (8/10) \- Driven by excellent ROAS, CPP, and purchase volume.  
* **Lowest Performing:** \[Evestar\] Evergreen DPA / USA / Advantage+ / Lowest Cost / 7-Day Click (3/10) and \[Evestar\] Joggers / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR) (2/10) \- Characterized by very poor ROAS, high costs, or lack of volume.

## **Aggregate Performance Health Analysis**

**Portfolio Health:**

* **53% of spend ($10,300.17) in healthy campaigns (7-8/10):** Slip Ons, Clearance, Trekk Boots, Luminous Collection.  
* **31% of spend ($6,007.67) requiring optimization (5-6/10):** Sandals, Camping Boots.  
* **16% of spend ($3,176.98) critical attention needed (1-4/10):** Evergreen DPA, April UGC Testing, Joggers.

**Structural Analysis Observations:**

* All active campaigns utilize the 'OUTCOME\_SALES' objective.  
* Heavy reliance on Advantage+ campaign types, with one ABO testing campaign (UGC).  
* Mix of specific product campaigns (Boots, Sandals, Slip-ons, Joggers) and broader strategies (Clearance, DPA, Luminous Collection). Potential audience overlap exists, particularly between the different boot campaigns (Trekk, Camping).  
* Creative strategies appear varied (product-focused, DPA, UGC testing).

**Performance Observations (Last 3 Days):**

* Overall portfolio ROAS is **1.80** ($35,053 Revenue / $19,485 Spend).  
* Average Cost Per Purchase (CPP) across the portfolio is **$61.47**.  
* Cost efficiency varies widely: CPMs range from $9.92 to $26.57, and Link CPLs range from $0.77 to $1.48 (excluding the very low spend Joggers campaign).  
* Several campaigns exhibit low Link CTRs, potentially impacting efficiency. High CPMs are observed in several campaigns, including the DPA and Luminous Collection.  
* Drop-off rate from Link Click to Landing Page View varies, with notable drop-offs in Sandals (18.7%), Camping Boots (18.8%), Slip Ons (18.1%), and Joggers (24.2%).

**Biggest Risks Right Now:**

* **Sub-Target ROAS:** Overall portfolio ROAS (1.80) is below a common 2.0+ target, driven by several underperforming campaigns.  
* **High Costs in Key Campaigns:** The Evergreen DPA campaign shows critically high CPP ($101.48) and high CPM ($22.73) despite significant spend ($2,942.99). Luminous Collection also has a very high CPM ($26.57).  
* **Inefficient Spend Allocation:** 16% of the budget is allocated to critically underperforming campaigns (ROAS \<1.31 or minimal volume). Another 31% is spent on campaigns needing optimization (ROAS 1.53-1.78).  
* **Low Click-Through Rates:** Multiple campaigns suffer from low Link CTRs (\<1.5%), particularly Slip Ons (0.90%), Camping Boots (1.05%), Sandals (1.28%), and UGC Testing (1.30%), suggesting potential creative fatigue or targeting misalignment.  
* **Performance Volatility:** Significant variance in ROAS (0 to 2.21) and CPP ($39 to $101) across campaigns indicates inconsistent performance delivery.

**7-Day Actionable Scaling Plan for Inkkas**

**Overall Goal:** Improve overall portfolio ROAS towards 2.0+ and efficiently scale profitable campaigns by reallocating budget, optimizing creatives, and refining audiences based on the last 3-7 days of performance data.

### **Day 1: Budget Reallocation & Stabilization**

* **Action:** Pause Critically Underperforming Campaigns.  
  * **Campaigns:** \[Evestar\] Joggers / USA / Lowest Cost / Advantage+ / (PUR) (Health: 2/10, Negligible ROAS), \[Evestar\] April 2025 UGC Testing / USA / ABO (Health: 4/10, 1.25 ROAS, Low Volume).  
  * **Rationale:** These campaigns represent inefficient spend (\<1.3 ROAS or minimal volume) based on recent performance. Pausing stops immediate budget drain.  
* **Action:** Significantly Reduce Budget or Restructure \[Evestar\] Evergreen DPA / USA / Advantage+ / Lowest Cost / 7-Day Click.  
  * **Current State:** Health: 3/10, ROAS 1.31, CPP $101.48 (Last 3 days).  
  * **Recommendation:** Reduce budget by 50-75% *immediately*.  
  * **Rationale:** High spend with very poor ROAS and high CPP. Needs fundamental review (product set, feed, audience, creatives) before receiving significant budget again. Consider focusing DPA *only* on top-performing product categories identified (Boots, Slip-ons, Luminous, Sandals) if restructuring.  
* **Action:** Initial Budget Increase for Top Performers.  
  * **Campaigns & Justification:**  
    * \[Evestar\] Slip Ons / USA (Health: 8/10, ROAS 2.21, CPP $50.47): Increase budget by 20%. Capitalize on highest efficiency.  
    * \[Evestar\] Luminous Collection / USA (Health: 7/10, ROAS 1.84, CPP $41.41, High CTR 2.67%): Increase budget by 15-20%. Strong efficiency and engagement despite high CPM. Monitor CPM closely.  
    * \[Evestar\] Clearance / USA (Health: 7/10, ROAS 2.04, Highest Revenue): Increase budget by 15%. Proven revenue driver.  
    * \[Evestar\] Trekk Boots / USA (Health: 7/10, ROAS 1.96, CPP $57.53): Increase budget by 15%. Solid ROAS and efficiency.  
  * **Rationale:** Shift budget from paused/reduced campaigns to campaigns demonstrating strong ROAS and purchase volume. Initial moderate increases allow monitoring before aggressive scaling.

### **Day 2: Analyze Mid-Tier & Creative Deep Dive**

* **Action:** Analyze Mid-Performing Campaigns for Optimization Levers.  
  * **Campaigns:** \[Evestar\] Camping Boots / USA (Health: 6/10, ROAS 1.78, Low CTR 1.05%), \[Evestar\] Sandals / USA (Health: 5/10, ROAS 1.53, Low CTR 1.28%, Lowest CPM $9.92).  
  * **Analysis:** Identify the best-performing *ads* within these campaigns. Are specific creatives driving the (below-target) ROAS? Are others pulling it down? Is the low CTR consistent across all ads, suggesting an audience/offer mismatch, or specific to certain creatives? Note the high Click-to-LPV drop-off rate for both (\~18%).  
  * **Rationale:** Understand *why* these campaigns are not hitting the 2.0+ ROAS target despite reasonable volume and CPP (Camping Boots) or low CPM (Sandals). Focus on creative angles and landing page experience.  
* **Action:** Identify Top Creative Elements Across All Campaigns.  
  * **Review:** Ad-level analysis highlights strong performance from UGC videos (especially testimonials/product-in-action), lifestyle imagery (nature backdrops), Western Boots, Sandals, and specific messages (Sustainability, Comfort, Handcrafted, Global Inspiration). Note top ROAS ads like Coronet Western Boot (16.33 ROAS but likely low spend/volume outlier \- verify), Brown Leather Camping Boot (4.97 ROAS), Cyprus Slide (3.10 ROAS), Luzon Buckle Sandal (3.02 ROAS).  
  * **Rationale:** Codify what is working visually and textually to replicate success.

### **Day 3: Creative Refresh & Launch (Part 1\)**

* **Action:** Develop 2-3 New Creative Variations for Low CTR Campaigns.  
  * **Focus Campaigns:** \[Evestar\] Camping Boots / USA, \[Evestar\] Sandals / USA, \[Evestar\] Slip Ons / USA (despite high ROAS, its CTR is lowest at 0.90%).  
  * **Creative Angles:** Based on Day 2 analysis:  
    * Develop UGC-style video ads for these categories (if not already running top-performing ones).  
    * Create static/video ads emphasizing Comfort \+ Style \+ Sustainability messaging.  
    * Test lifestyle imagery relevant to each product (Camping for boots, casual/travel for slip-ons/sandals).  
    * Incorporate strong social proof elements (e.g., "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️", "Thousands Love…", specific testimonial quotes).  
  * **Rationale:** Directly address the low CTR in these potentially high-volume campaigns with proven creative approaches.  
* **Action:** Launch New Creatives into Relevant Ad Sets.  
  * **Implementation:** Add these new ads to the existing ad sets within the targeted campaigns. Do not stop existing well-performing ads yet. Let the algorithm optimize delivery.  
  * **Rationale:** Introduce fresh creative to combat potential fatigue and improve engagement metrics.

### **Day 4: Creative Refresh & Launch (Part 2\)**

* **Action:** Develop & Launch New Creatives for Top Performing Campaigns.  
  * **Focus Campaigns:** \[Evestar\] Luminous Collection / USA, \[Evestar\] Trekk Boots / USA, \[Evestar\] Clearance / USA.  
  * **Creative Angles:** Replicate the *style* and *messaging* of the absolute best ads (e.g., structure of the Brown Leather Camping Boot video, multi-angle shots like Coronet Western Boot, messaging themes). Create variations featuring different products from these collections/categories but using the winning formulas.  
  * **Rationale:** Prevent creative fatigue in high-spending, high-performing campaigns and potentially unlock even higher performance by iterating on success.  
* **Action:** Review Ad-Level Performance in Scaled Campaigns.  
  * **Focus:** Check if specific ads within the budget-increased campaigns (Slip Ons, Luminous, Clearance, Trekk) are absorbing the extra spend efficiently. Pause any ads within these campaigns showing significantly below-average ROAS or CTR after the budget increase.  
  * **Rationale:** Ensure increased budget is flowing to the most efficient creatives within the winning campaigns.

### **Day 5: Audience & Funnel Optimization**

* **Action:** Analyze Advantage+ Performance & Potential Refinements.  
  * **Review:** Check audience insights within Advantage+ campaigns (if available). Are there demographic or interest signals performing exceptionally well that could inform future testing or manual campaign setups? For now, primarily trust the algorithm unless performance significantly dips.  
  * **Rationale:** Understand if Advantage+ is optimizing effectively and gather insights for future strategy.  
* **Action:** Investigate Click-to-Landing Page View Drop-offs.  
  * **Focus Campaigns:** Sandals (18.7%), Camping Boots (18.8%), Slip Ons (18.1%), Joggers (24.2% \- Paused but note for future).  
  * **Check:** Verify landing page URLs in the ads are correct. Check page load speed on mobile for these specific product/category pages. Ensure the ad creative strongly matches the landing page content.  
  * **Rationale:** A high drop-off here wastes clicks and indicates friction early in the funnel. Improving this can significantly boost conversion rates.  
* **Action:** Monitor Frequency in Scaled Campaigns.  
  * **Threshold:** Keep an eye on frequency for campaigns receiving budget increases. If frequency starts exceeding \~1.7 within the 7-day window, prepare to broaden audience slightly (if using Advantage+ with limited controls, rely on creative rotation) or introduce more creative variations.  
  * **Rationale:** Proactively manage potential audience saturation, although current levels seem healthy.

### **Day 6: Performance Check & Consolidation**

* **Action:** Review Performance of New Creatives (Launched Days 3 & 4).  
  * **Metrics:** Look for early indicators: Is CTR improving in the target campaigns (Camping Boots, Sandals, Slip Ons)? Are the new creatives getting delivery and showing initial positive ROAS/CPP?  
  * **Decision:** Identify any standout new winners and consider shifting more budget towards them within the ad set. Pause any new creatives showing extremely poor initial results (e.g., zero purchases after significant impressions/clicks).  
  * **Rationale:** Make rapid adjustments based on initial data from new tests.  
* **Action:** Evaluate Budget Shift Impact.  
  * **Metrics:** Check the ROAS and CPP for the campaigns that received budget increases on Day 1 (Slip Ons, Luminous, Clearance, Trekk). Has performance remained stable or improved with the increased spend?  
  * **Decision:** If performance holds/improves, consider another small budget increase (10-15%) for Day 7\. If performance dipped significantly, hold budget steady and re-evaluate creative/audience factors.  
  * **Rationale:** Validate the scaling strategy and adjust spend based on observed efficiency at higher levels.

### **Day 7: Review, Report & Plan Next Steps**

* **Action:** Consolidate 7-Day Performance & Key Learnings.  
  * **Report:** Summarize changes made (pauses, budget shifts, creative launches). Report on overall portfolio ROAS change compared to the start of the week. Highlight winning/losing campaigns, ad sets, and creatives based on the week's actions. Note improvements in CTR or funnel metrics.  
  * **Learnings:** What creative styles/messages worked best? Did fixing the Click-LPV drop-off help? How did Advantage+ handle scaling?  
* **Action:** Formulate Recommendations for the Following Week.  
  * **Scaling:** Which campaigns/ad sets are ready for further scaling based on sustained high ROAS?  
  * **Optimization:** Which campaigns still need work (e.g., Evergreen DPA if restructured, Sandals/Camping Boots if CTR didn't improve)?  
  * **Testing:** What new creative angles or audience hypotheses emerged from the week's analysis? Plan the next round of creative testing.  
  * **Strategy:** Consider if campaign structure needs adjustment (e.g., consolidating boot campaigns if performance is similar, creating new campaigns based on top product types like Western Boots or Sandals).  
  * **Rationale:** Use the insights gained during the 7-day plan to inform ongoing optimization and scaling efforts, creating a continuous improvement loop.
