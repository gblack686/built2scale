# Notebook Development Status & Next Steps: Mavrix AI Google Ads Report

## Comparison with `7D Google Ads Report for Mavrix AI (Primary) - 4_14_2025.md`

This document outlines a hypothetical development plan for a Jupyter notebook intended to replicate the analysis found in the `7D Google Ads Report for Mavrix AI (Primary) - 4_14_2025.md`.

**Legend:**
*   游릭 **PRESENT/GOOD START:** Core structure or initial data queries are in place (hypothetically, for a new notebook, these would be the planned markdown headers).
*   游리 **NEEDS WORK/PLACEHOLDER:** Section exists (or would be planned) but requires data queries, calculations, or significant content.
*   游댮 **MISSING:** Section or functionality from the target report is not yet addressed (for a new notebook, this means the queries and data analysis are entirely missing).

## Recommended Next Steps for Notebook Development (Mavrix AI Google Ads Report):

1.  **Establish Data Sources & Schema Understanding (Google Ads Data):**
    *   Identify BigQuery tables (or other data sources) for Google Ads performance data.
    *   Understand the schema: `campaign_name`, `ad_group_name`, `ad_id` (or creative ID), `date`, `clicks`, `impressions`, `cost`, `conversions`, `conversion_value` (for revenue/ROAS), `optimization_score`, `ctr`, `video_views`, `search_impression_share`, etc.

2.  **Core Campaign-Level Queries (Executive Summary & 3-Day Overview):**
    *   Implement SQL queries to fetch campaign-level performance data.
    *   Aggregate overall metrics (Total Clicks, Cost, Conversions, etc.).
    *   Develop queries to filter data for the "Last 3 Days" and "Last 7 Days."
    *   Calculate key metrics: CPC, Cost Per Conversion, ROAS (if revenue data is available), CTR.

3.  **Ad Group Level Queries:**
    *   Implement SQL queries to fetch performance data grouped by `ad_group_name` (and `campaign_name`).
    *   Calculate Ad Group specific metrics (Clicks, Cost, Conversions, CTR, CPM, etc.).

4.  **Ad (Creative) Level Queries:**
    *   Implement SQL queries to fetch performance data for individual ads (creatives) within Ad Groups.
    *   This is crucial for the "Top Performing Ads" section.

5.  **Health Score Logic (Conceptualization & Implementation - Optional Advanced Step):**
    *   Define criteria and thresholds for "Health Scores" for Campaigns and Ad Groups based on key metrics (e.g., ROAS, CPA targets, Conversion Volume, CTR benchmarks).
    *   Implement Python functions or SQL case statements to calculate these scores.

6.  **Structure Notebook and Add Qualitative Insights:**
    *   Organize queries and outputs (DataFrames, plots if any) into sections corresponding to the report.
    *   Add markdown cells for observations, reasoning (especially for health scores if implemented), and recommendations based on the queried data.

7.  **Specific Metrics from Report to Target:**
    *   Ensure queries can pull `optimization_score` (often directly available from Google Ads API/exports).
    *   `Engagement Rate` (clarify definition if it's different from CTR or Interaction Rate from Google Ads).
    *   `Video Views`.
    *   `Ad Strength` (for ads/ad groups).
