# Notebook Development Status & Next Steps: Inkkas Facebook Creative Strategy Report

## Comparison with `Example Creative Strategy Ads Report for Inkkas.md`

This document outlines a hypothetical development plan for a Jupyter notebook to support and analyze the findings in the `Example Creative Strategy Ads Report for Inkkas.md`. This report, like other creative strategy documents, is heavily qualitative. A notebook would primarily serve to analyze underlying ad component performance (if data is available and structured for it) and to organize/present the strategic frameworks.

**Legend:**
*   游릭 **PRESENT/GOOD START:** Core structure or initial data queries are in place (hypothetically, for a new notebook, these would be the planned markdown headers or data display cells).
*   游리 **NEEDS WORK/PLACEHOLDER:** Section exists (or would be planned) but requires data input, more complex analysis, or significant content.
*   游댮 **MISSING:** Section or functionality from the target report is not yet addressed (e.g., underlying data queries for component performance).

### 1. **Creative Diagnosis & Matrix (Facebook Ads)**
*   **Overall Structure (Main Header):** 游릭
*   **Facebook Ads Creative Matrix (Display):** 游리 (Could be a markdown table, or a Pandas DataFrame. The content is derived from analyzed top performers.)
*   **Underlying Data Analysis for Top Performers (to build/validate the matrix):** 游댮
    *   Queries to fetch performance data (CTR, CVR, CPA, ROAS etc.) for individual Facebook ad components: Hooks (e.g., first 3 seconds of video, image type), Headlines, Primary Texts, Visuals (by ID, type, or tag), CTAs.
    *   Analysis to identify which combinations or individual components perform best for different angles (Pain Point, Dream Outcome, etc.). This is a complex analytical task requiring granular ad creative data.
*   **Creative Performance Insights & Recommendations (High-Converting Themes, Audience-Specific Performance, Optimization Opportunities):** 游리 (Markdown cells summarizing findings from the matrix and any underlying component analysis performed).

### 2. **Facebook Ad Creative Strategy Brief**
*   **Overall Structure (Main Header):** 游릭
*   **Executive Summary (Descriptive):** 游리 (Markdown cell).
*   **Top Performing Creative Elements (Hook, Visual, Copy - with % impact stats):**
    *   **Structure (Sub-headers):** 游릭
    *   **Data to Support % Impact Stats:** 游댮 (Requires querying and comparing performance of ads with/without these specific elements).
    *   **Descriptive elements:** 游리 (Markdown cells).
*   **Content Strategy Recommendations (Table: Component, Best Practice, Implementation):** 游리 (Markdown table or DataFrame).
*   **Audience Alignment Strategy (Descriptive):** 游리 (Markdown cell).
*   **Testing Framework (Descriptive - Hook Variations, Visual A/B Testing, CTA Optimization):** 游리 (Markdown cell).
*   **Implementation Timeline (Descriptive):** 游리 (Markdown cell).
*   **Measurement Criteria (Descriptive - ROAS, CTR, Engagement, CPA targets):** 游리 (Markdown cell).

### 3. **10 High-Converting Ad Angles (Facebook Ads)**
*   **Overall Structure (Main Header/Section per Angle):** 游릭
*   **For each Angle (e.g., "The Wanderlust Transformer"):**
    *   **Structure (Angle Sub-header):** 游릭
    *   **Angle Name, Target Emotion, Awareness Level, Core Promise (Descriptive):** 游리 (Markdown cells or structured data display).
    *   **Emotional Strategy (Current State, Desired State, Transformation, Universal Connection):** 游리 (Markdown cells).
    *   **Key Messages (Example Ad Copy):** 游리 (Markdown list or table).
    *   *A notebook could potentially help test or track the performance of ads built using these angles if naming conventions or tagging allow for mapping back.* (游댮 for tracking implementation)

## Recommended Next Steps for Notebook Development (Inkkas Facebook Creative Strategy):

1.  **Define Data Sources for Ad Component Analysis (Facebook Ads Data):**
    *   Determine if Facebook ad component data (ad creative ID, body text, headline text, link description, image hash/video ID, CTA type) and their respective performance metrics are available and queryable from BigQuery or other sources.
    *   This might involve data from Facebook Ads API exports, ensuring creative asset details are captured alongside performance.

2.  **Develop Ad Component Performance Queries (Advanced):**
    *   If data from Step 1 exists, create SQL queries to extract performance (CTR, CVR, CPA, ROAS etc.) for distinct creative elements.
    *   This would allow for data-driven validation or generation of the "top performers" that feed into the Creative Matrix and the "% impact stats" in the strategy brief.
    *   Consider how to analyze video hooks (e.g., performance of ads using specific video intros, if such data is logged or can be inferred).

3.  **Structure Notebook for Presenting Strategic Frameworks:**
    *   Use markdown cells to replicate the **Creative Matrix**, **Content Strategy Recommendations Table**, and the details for each of the **10 Marketing Angles**.
    *   Use Pandas DataFrames for displaying tables if beneficial (e.g., loading from CSVs, enabling sorting/filtering).

4.  **Qualitative Summaries and Data-Driven Insights:**
    *   Incorporate the markdown cells for "Creative Performance Insights & Recommendations" and other qualitative sections.
    *   If ad component analysis is performed, the notebook should include cells to summarize these data-driven findings, supporting or refining the qualitative observations.

5.  **Connecting Strategy to Performance (Future Enhancement):**
    *   Develop a system (e.g., through ad naming conventions or tagging) to track ads created based on these strategic angles and components.
    *   Future notebook work could involve querying the performance of these new ads and correlating their success to the strategic elements they employed.

6.  **Focus on Presentation and Organization:**
    *   A key role of the notebook will be to clearly organize and present these creative frameworks. Effective use of markdown, headers, and potentially data visualizations (if component performance is analyzed) will be crucial.

**Key Challenge:** As with other creative strategy reports, the main difficulty for a *data-driven* notebook is accessing and analyzing performance at the very granular level of individual ad *components*. If this data isn't available or structured for easy analysis, the notebook will mainly serve as an organizational and presentational tool for the strategic content of the report.
