# Notebook Development Status & Next Steps: Mavrix AI Google Ads Creative Strategy Report

## Comparison with `7D Google Ads Creative Strategy for Mavrix AI (Primary) - 04_14_2025.md`

This document outlines a hypothetical development plan for a Jupyter notebook to support and analyze the findings in the `7D Google Ads Creative Strategy for Mavrix AI (Primary) - 04_14_2025.md`. This report is heavily qualitative and strategic; a notebook would primarily serve to analyze underlying ad component data if available, and to organize/present the strategic frameworks.

**Legend:**
*   游릭 **PRESENT/GOOD START:** Core structure or initial data queries are in place (hypothetically, for a new notebook, these would be the planned markdown headers or data display cells).
*   游리 **NEEDS WORK/PLACEHOLDER:** Section exists (or would be planned) but requires data input, more complex analysis, or significant content.
*   游댮 **MISSING:** Section or functionality from the target report is not yet addressed (e.g., underlying data queries for component performance).

---

### 1. **Creative Diagnosis & Matrix**
*   **Overall Structure (Main Header):** 游릭
*   **Google Ads Creative Matrix (Display):** 游리 (Could be a markdown table, or a Pandas DataFrame created from a CSV/dict for easier display and potential filtering if it becomes very large. The content is from analyzed top performers.)
*   **Underlying Data Analysis for Top Performers (to build/validate the matrix):** 游댮
    *   Queries to fetch performance data (CTR, CVR, CPA, etc.) for individual ad components: Hooks, Headlines, Primary Texts, Visuals (by ID or tag), CTAs.
    *   Analysis to identify which combinations or individual components perform best for different angles (Pain Point, Dream Outcome, etc.). This is a complex analytical task.
*   **Key Implications & Observations (Qualitative Summary):** 游리 (Markdown cell based on matrix and underlying analysis if performed).

### 2. **Creative Strategy for Mavrix AI**
*   **Overall Structure (Main Header):** 游릭
*   **Executive Summary (Descriptive):** 游리 (Markdown cell).
*   **Winning Creative Elements (Brand Overview Table):** 游리 (Markdown table or DataFrame display).
*   **Creative Component Analysis (Hook, Headlines, Primary Text, Visual Strategy, CTAs):**
    *   **Structure (Sub-headers):** 游릭
    *   **Winning Elements, Key Patterns, Strategic Direction (Descriptive for each component):** 游리 (Markdown cells, derived from the initial matrix/analysis).
    *   *Potential for data-driven validation if component analysis (from section 1) is done.*
*   **Implications and Observations (Qualitative Summary for this section):** 游리 (Markdown cell).

---

### 3. **Marketing Angles (10 Angles Detailed)**
*   **Overall Structure (Main Header/Section per Angle):** 游릭
*   **For each Angle (e.g., "The AI Advantage Revolution"):**
    *   **Structure (Angle Sub-header):** 游릭
    *   **Target Emotion, Awareness Level, Core Promise (Descriptive):** 游리 (Markdown cells or structured data display).
    *   **Emotional Strategy (Current State, Desired State, Transformation, Universal Connection):** 游리 (Markdown cells).
    *   **Key Messages (Example Ad Copy):** 游리 (Markdown list or table).
    *   *A notebook could potentially help test or track the performance of ads built using these angles if naming conventions allow for mapping back.* (游댮 for tracking implementation)

## Recommended Next Steps for Notebook Development (Mavrix AI Google Ads Creative Strategy):

1.  **Define Data Sources for Ad Component Analysis (If Possible):**
    *   Determine if ad component data (individual headlines, descriptions, image IDs, CTA texts) and their respective performance metrics are available and queryable from BigQuery or other sources.
    *   This might involve specific tagging or naming conventions for creative assets during ad creation.

2.  **Develop Ad Component Performance Queries (Advanced):**
    *   If data from Step 1 exists, create SQL queries to extract performance (CTR, CVR, Cost per Result) for distinct creative elements (Headlines, Descriptions, Call to Actions, possibly Image/Video references).
    *   This would be the most data-intensive part and allow for data-driven validation or generation of the "top performers" that feed into the Creative Matrix.

3.  **Structure Notebook for Presenting Strategic Frameworks:**
    *   Use markdown cells to replicate the **Creative Matrix**, **Winning Creative Elements Table**, and the details for each of the **10 Marketing Angles**.
    *   Consider using Pandas DataFrames for displaying tables if they are extensive or if you want to enable programmatic manipulation/filtering in the future (e.g., load from CSVs).

4.  **Qualitative Summaries and Observations:**
    *   Incorporate the markdown cells for "Key Implications & Observations" sections as provided in the report.
    *   If ad component analysis is performed, the notebook should include cells to summarize findings from that data, which would then support or refine the qualitative observations.

5.  **Connecting Strategy to Performance (Future Enhancement):**
    *   Think about how ads created based on these strategic angles and components will be tracked.
    *   Future notebook development could involve querying the performance of new ads and attempting to correlate their success/failure back to the strategic elements they employed (e.g., ads using "Angle 1" with "Pain Point Hook Style A"). This requires robust ad naming conventions and tracking.

6.  **Focus on Presentation and Organization:**
    *   Given the strategic nature, a key role of the notebook would be to clearly organize and present these frameworks. Good use of markdown, headers, and potentially data visualizations (if component performance is analyzed) will be important.

**Key Challenge:** The primary challenge for a *data-driven* notebook accompanying this report is obtaining and analyzing performance at the granular level of individual ad *components* (hook, headline, visual, etc.). If this data is not readily available or structured for such analysis, the notebook will primarily serve as an organizational and presentational tool for the strategic content already defined in the markdown report.
