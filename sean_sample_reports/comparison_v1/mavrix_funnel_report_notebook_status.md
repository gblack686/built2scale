# Notebook Development Status & Next Steps: Mavrix AI Funnel Report

## Comparison with `Mavrix AI (Primary) Funnel Report - 4_11_2025.md`

This document outlines a hypothetical development plan for a Jupyter notebook intended to replicate the analysis found in the `Mavrix AI (Primary) Funnel Report - 4_11_2025.md`.

**Legend:**
*   ðŸŸ¢ **PRESENT/GOOD START:** Core structure or initial data queries are in place (hypothetically, for a new notebook, these would be the planned markdown headers).
*   ðŸŸ¡ **NEEDS WORK/PLACEHOLDER:** Section exists (or would be planned) but requires data queries, calculations, or significant content.
*   ðŸ”´ **MISSING:** Section or functionality from the target report is not yet addressed (for a new notebook, this means the queries and data analysis are entirely missing).

## Recommended Next Steps for Notebook Development (Mavrix AI Funnel Report):

1.  **Establish Data Sources & Schema Understanding:**
    *   Identify the BigQuery tables (or other data sources) that contain the necessary funnel data: page views, events per stage, traffic sources, ad spend, conversions, revenue, user segmentation data.
    *   Understand the schema: column names for timestamps, page URLs, event names, user IDs, source/medium, campaign names, device, geography, etc.

2.  **Core Metric Queries (Executive Summary & Overall Funnel):**
    *   Implement SQL queries for the "Critical Metrics Overview": CVR, Revenue, Ad Spend, ROAS, CPL, CPC, Total Leads, Total Impressions.
    *   Queries for "Overall Funnel Metrics": Total Users, Page Views, overall Funnel Conversion Rate.

3.  **Funnel Stage-by-Stage Breakdown Queries:**
    *   For each defined funnel stage (Opt-In pages, Video, Survey, Call, Confirm):
        *   Query user counts, leads/opt-ins, and conversions at each specific page URL or event defining the stage.
        *   Query traffic sources leading to these stages/pages.
        *   Query bounce rates and engagement rates for key landing pages in the funnel.
    *   Calculate drop-off rates between consecutive stages.

4.  **Traffic Source Performance Queries:**
    *   Queries for clicks, impressions, spend (if available) per traffic source (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads).
    *   Calculate CPC, CPL, and ROAS per traffic source if data permits.

5.  **Segmentation Queries:**
    *   Queries to segment funnel performance (users, conversions, rates) by:
        *   Demographics (e.g., Country).
        *   Device, Browser.
        *   New vs. Returning Users.
        *   Specific entry opt-in pages (Google Opt-in, FB Opt-in etc.)

6.  **KPI Calculations:**
    *   Implement calculation for CPA.
    *   Address "Average Time to Conversion" â€“ determine if this can be calculated from event timestamps or if it will remain descriptive.

7.  **Structure Notebook and Add Qualitative Insights:**
    *   Organize queries and their outputs (DataFrames, plots) into sections corresponding to the report.
    *   Add markdown cells for descriptive text, observations, and recommendations based on the queried data.
