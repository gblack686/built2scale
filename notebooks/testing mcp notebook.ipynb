These often require more granular event tracking data than what is available in `v1_b2s_all_acquisition_production_report`.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Product Format Analysis:** (e.g., \"Boots & Outdoor Styles consistently outperform other categories with 32% higher ROAS\", \"Western Boots show the highest engagement\")\n",
    "*   **Creative Format Analysis:** (e.g., \"UGC-style videos showing product in action drive 43% higher CTR than static images\", \"Lifestyle imagery with nature backdrops outperforms studio shots by 28%\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Requirements for Programmatic Replication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Automating this type of analysis would typically require:\n",
    "1.  **Structured Tags/Labels:** Additional metadata fields in your data source that explicitly tag each ad or campaign with its `product_format` (e.g., \"Boots\", \"Sandals\", \"Accessory\") and `creative_format` (e.g., \"UGC Video\", \"Static Image - Studio\", \"Static Image - Lifestyle\", \"Carousel\").\n",
    "2.  **Granular Ad-Level Data:** Access to performance metrics at the individual ad creative level if not already using it.\n",
    "3.  **Comparative Analysis Logic:** Code to group by these tags, calculate average performance for each, and then compare them to derive insights like \"X outperforms Y by Z%\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Without such structured tags and potentially more granular ad-level data easily queryable for these specific attributes, this analysis remains largely qualitative, drawing conclusions by observing trends in campaign/ad names and their associated performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative data generated in the previous sections (e.g., campaign performance, inferred product category performance) can serve as a starting point for manually deriving these kinds_of insights."

While overall frequency can be calculated (as done in the Ad Set section), optimal ranges and platform-specific delivery insights often require more detailed breakdown or A/B test data.\n",
