# Notebook Development Status & Next Steps

## Comparison with `7D Facebook Ads Report for Inkkas.md`

This document outlines the current status of the `testing mcp notebook.ipynb` in relation to the target `7D Facebook Ads Report for Inkkas.md` and defines the areas needing development.

**Legend:**
*   游릭 **PRESENT/GOOD START:** Core structure or initial data queries are in place.
*   游리 **NEEDS WORK/PLACEHOLDER:** Section exists but requires data queries, calculations, or significant content.
*   游댮 **MISSING:** Section or functionality from the target report is not yet addressed in the notebook.

### 1. **Executive Facebook Campaign Summary - Inkkas**
*   **Overall Structure:** 游릭
*   **Overall Performance Metrics (`df_overall_metrics`):** 游릭 (Spend, Impressions, Reach, ROAS, Purchases, CPP)
*   **Campaign Performance Highlights (`df_campaign_highlights`):** 游릭 (Top campaigns by ROAS, Spend, Purchases, CPP, CTR)
*   **Conversion Funnel Analysis (`df_funnel_analysis`):** 游릭 (ATC, IC, Purchases, conversion rates)
*   **Audience Engagement:** 游리 (Query for Clicks, CTR needed for cell 9)
*   **Traffic and Lead Generation:** 游리 (Query for Landing Page Views, Leads, CPL needed for cell 11)
*   **Product Category Performance:** 游리 (Complex query for product category level data needed for cell 13)
*   *Qualitative narrative from markdown report largely missing; notebook focuses on numbers.*

### 2. **Facebook Campaign Performance Overview: Inkkas (Last 3 Days)** (around Notebook Cell 14)
*   **Overall Structure (Header):** 游릭
*   **Data Queries for "Last 3 Days":** 游댮
*   **Campaign-Level Metrics Breakdown (detailed per campaign):** 游댮
*   **Health Score Logic & Calculation:** 游댮
*   **Aggregate Performance Health Analysis (Last 3 Days):** 游댮
*   **"Biggest Risks" (Qualitative):** 游댮 (Currently only a conceptual part of the target report)

### 3. **INKKAS FACEBOOK AD SET ANALYSIS** (around Notebook Cell 15)
*   **Overall Structure (Header):** 游릭
*   **Ad Set Level Data Queries:** 游댮 (Metrics like ROAS, Spend, CPP, CPM, CTR, Frequency per ad set)
*   **Ad Set Health Score Logic & Calculation:** 游댮
*   **Qualitative Sections (Optimization & Opportunities):** 游댮

### 4. **INKKAS FACEBOOK ADS PERFORMANCE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Last 7 Days)** (around Notebook Cell 16)
*   **Overall Structure (Headers for sub-sections):** 游릭
*   **A. OVERVIEW: Last 7 Days Performance:** 游리 (Can reuse/refine `df_overall_metrics`)
*   **B. TOP PERFORMING AD CREATIVE FORMATS (Qualitative Insights):** 游리 (Markdown placeholder)
*   **C. TOP PERFORMING CAMPAIGNS (Last 7 Days):** 游릭 (Uses `df_campaign_highlights`, acknowledges qualitative gaps)
*   **D. Further Executive Summary Insights (Qualitative - Audience, Frequency, Creative Drivers, etc.):** 游리 (Markdown placeholder)
*   **Ad-Level Performance Data Queries:** 游댮 (Crucial for "Key Performers," "Creative Performance Drivers," detailed "Ad Performance Analysis" including specific ad ROAS values)
*   **Conversion Path Insights:** 游댮 (Complex, likely out of scope for initial BQ queries)

---

### 5. **Actionable Scaling Plan (Strategic Output)** (around Notebook Cell 23)
*   **Overall Structure (Header):** 游릭
*   **Detailed Strategic Plan Content:** 游댮 (Notebook will provide data; plan formulation is a higher-level analytical task)

---

## Recommended Next Steps for Notebook Development:

1.  **Complete Basic Data Queries (First Executive Summary):**
    *   **Audience Engagement (Cell 9):** Implement SQL query for total clicks and average CTR.
    *   **Traffic and Lead Generation (Cell 11):** Implement SQL query for landing page views, total leads, and CPL.
    *   **Product Category Performance (Cell 13):** Design and implement SQL queries for performance metrics aggregated by product category. This may require identifying relevant tables and join conditions.

2.  **Develop "Facebook Campaign Performance Overview (Last 3 Days)" Section:**
    *   Create SQL queries to filter relevant data for the "Last 3 Days."
    *   Develop queries to extract detailed campaign-level metrics for this period.
    *   *Conceptualize (and optionally, begin to implement) logic for "Health Scores."*
    *   Query for aggregate metrics for this period (e.g., overall ROAS, CPP).

3.  **Build "INKKAS FACEBOOK AD SET ANALYSIS" Section:**
    *   Create SQL queries to fetch comprehensive performance data grouped by ad set.
    *   *Conceptualize (and optionally, begin to implement) logic for ad set "Health Scores."*

4.  **Implement Ad-Level Data Queries (for Second Executive Summary):**
    *   Design and implement SQL queries to retrieve performance metrics at the individual ad level (ad_id or ad_name). This is critical for populating sections like "Creative Performance Drivers" and "Key Performers."

5.  **Address Qualitative Insights Incrementally:**
    *   As quantitative data becomes available through the queries, begin to note down observations or key data points that would feed into the qualitative sections. Full qualitative generation may remain manual or require advanced techniques.
